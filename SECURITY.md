## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a critical vulnerability in this project, we 
are grateful if you report it on a non-public channel so that 
we can fix it without inviting attacks.

You can send an email to the maintainer, using 
the maintainers first name and the domain advertised on
the profile page.

If you find a non-critical issue, just file an issue.
